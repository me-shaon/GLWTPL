# GLWTPL (Good Luck With That Public License)

[![GLWTPL](https://img.shields.io/badge/GLWT-Public_License-red.svg)](https://github.com/me-shaon/GLWTPL)

If you have *that* feeling about your code...

```
When I wrote this, only God and I understood what I was doing.
Now, only God knows.
```

...think no further and include [this LICENSE](./LICENSE) to your project!

And, wish a very **Good Luck** to your future self, or a fellow human being or an alien or an AI bot (who can code and will destroy human race) - literally anyone who will dare to dive into your project.

It has a [NSFW version](./NSFW_LICENSE) too. Cheers!

### Possible Use Cases
- You wrote some code but not quite proud of it, yet want to release it.
- You want to make free your code in the wild and want no responsibility for it.
- "Whatever done is done", and you don't have time/intention to fix, modify or improve your code any further
- Built an awesome project in a Hackathon/Code-competition? Want to license it? This is the license for you.
- Your college/university course/lab work and this license are a match made in heaven.
