# GLWTPL (Good Luck With That Public License)

If you have *that* feeling about your code...

```
When I wrote this, only God and I understood what I was doing.
Now, only God knows.
```

...think no further and include [this LICENSE](./LICENSE) to your project!

It has a [NSFW version](./NSFW_LICENSE) too. Cheers!

### Possible Use Cases
- You wrote some code but not quite proud of it, yet want to release it.
- You want to make free your code in the wild and want no responsibility for it.
- "Whatever done is done", and you don't have time/intention to fix, modify or improve your code any further
- Built an awesome project in a Hackathon/Code-competition? Want to license it? This is the license for you.
